## This is my report!

I like writing **reports**

This is the code we will look at in class. Thisis just plain old Markdown that lets you rendertext in **bold** or _italics_. However, you canput in a block of R code, and the document willshow the code and the results!


``` {r example, include = FALSE} 
library(knitr)
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)  # save the mean
img_url <- "https://cdn3-www.dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/10/puppies-cover.jpg"
 im

letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
numbers <- 1:4
df <- data.frame(letters = letters, numbers = numbers)



```

`r kable(df)`
The mean of the numbers happen to the be **`r numbers_mean`**.

``` {r other_chunk}
print(numbers)
```
